# Overview

The company that I desire to work for primarily programs in the Pick/BASIC programming language. This language is an older programming language designed in the 1970s. The purpose of this program was to take the basics of Pick/BASIC and to "translate" a program that I had previously written in Python into Pick/BASIC.

The program is a Pokemon Type Selector/Randomizer. Using the Pokedex from the original Pokemon games, this program will allow the user to select up to two types that can be random, and the program will take those types and display all pokemon from the original Pokemon game and save them to a file.
